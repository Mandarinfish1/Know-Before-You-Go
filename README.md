#Know Before You Go!

## Description

- We have made an app that provides event information as well as weather information for events the user looks up.
- We built this project because we noticed that many apps on the internet provide event information but not weather information.
- Having the weather feature on an event app makes our app unique as well as beneficial.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, TICKETMASTER API, WEATHER API.

## Installation

- No installation required to install application.

## Usage

(Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.)
